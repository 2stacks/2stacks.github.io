I had a few Arduino projects that I wanted to port over to Micropython since python is my language of choice these days.
Most of my dev boards are some version of ESP8266 and following the instructions [@micropython.org][0] was pretty easy.

Check out the work I've done so far on [GitHub][3] or on [Hackster.io][2]
